# Security Policy

Our repository goes through static code analysis and manual review for any security issues/vulnerabilities. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any issues or security vulnerabilities you want to report, please add them to the Issues section. The maintainers of this project will review.

After review, the maintainers will work on a patch and update the main branch if the vulnerability is found and accepted.
